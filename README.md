# RaspberryPi Binary Clock

## Getting started

In order to setup your RaspberryPi for NeoPixels, follow the guide over at [https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixels-on-raspberry-pi/]() - they'll explain the wiring and installation of required libraries.

## Hardware
- Raspberry PI
- 18 NeoPixels (in strips of 6 pixels)

## Software

The softer parts of this project is written in Python (I'm definitely not a Pyton programmer so I'm sure there are improvments to be made in the src - feel free to submit a pull request).

## YouTube Video
